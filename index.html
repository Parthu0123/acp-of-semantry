                <h3>Thor</h3>
                <p>In 965 AD, Odin, king of Asgard, wages war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and their leader
                    Laufey, to prevent
                    them from conquering the Nine Realms, starting with Earth.<br> The Asgardians defeat the Frost
                    Giants and seize the source
                    of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters.<br>

                    In the present, Odin's son Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard but is interrupted when
                    Frost Giants,
                    secretly allowed in by his brother Loki, attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor
                    travels to Jotunheim
                    to confront Laufey, accompanied by Loki, childhood friend Sif and the Warriors Three: Volstagg,
                    Fandral, and Hogun. A
                    battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the
                    two races. As
                    punishment for Thor's arrogance, Odin deems his son unworthy, strips him of his powers and exiles
                    him to Earth as a
                    mortal, accompanied by his hammer Mjölnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the
                    worthy to wield it.<br>

                    Thor lands in New Mexico, where astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy Lewis, and
                    mentor Dr. Erik Selvig
                    find him. The local populace discovers Mjölnir, which S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson soon
                    commandeers before forcibly
                    acquiring Foster's data about the wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth. Having learned about
                    Mjölnir's nearby location,
                    Thor seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed and tries to lift it,
                    but is unable to do
                    so and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he
                    develops a romance with
                    Foster.<br>

                    Loki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. Loki
                    confronts Odin, who wearily
                    falls into the deep "Odinsleep" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and
                    offers Laufey the
                    chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule,
                    attempt to return
                    Thor from exile, convincing Heimdall, gatekeeper of the Bifröst—the means of traveling between
                    worlds—to allow them
                    passage to Earth.</p>
